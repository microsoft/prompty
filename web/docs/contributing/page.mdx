## About Prompty
[Prompty](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) is an open-source project from Microsoft that makes it easy for developers to _create, manage, debug, and evaluate_ LLM prompts for generative AI applications. We welcome contributions from the community that can help make the technology more useful, and usable, by developers from all backgrounds. Before you get started, review this page for contributor guidelines.

## Code Of Conduct
Read the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it. The project is also governed by the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct - [Read their FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) to learn why the CoC matters and how you can raise concerns or provide feedback.

## Providing feedback

Feedback can come in several forms:
 - Tell us about a missing feature or enhancement request
 - Let us know if you found errors or ambiguity in the documentation
 - Report bugs or inconsistent behavior seen with Prompty tools and usage

The easiest way to give us feedback is by [filing an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty/issues/new). **Please check previously logged issues (open and closed) to make sure the topic or bug has not already been raised.** If it does exist, weigh in on that discussion thread to add any additional context of value.

## Contributor guidelines
The repository contains both the code and the documentation for the project. Each requires a different set of tools and processes to build and preview outcomes. 

## Pull Requests Guidelines
When submitting a pull request (PR) to the Prompty repository, please use the following guidelines:

- Fork the Repository: Always fork the repository to your own account before making your modifications.
- Separate pull requests (PR):
  - Submit each type of change in its own pull request. For example, bug fixes and documentation updates should be submitted in separate PRs.
  - Typo fixes and minor documentation updates can be combined into a single PR where appropriate.
  - Handle merge conflicts: If your pull request shows merge conflicts, update your local main branch to mirror the main repository before making your modifications.
