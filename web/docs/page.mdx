## 1. Introduction

<br/>
[Prompty](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) is an asset class and format for LLM prompts designed to enhance observability, understandability, and portability for developers. The primary goal is to accelerate the developer inner loop of _prompt engineering_ and _prompt source management_ in a cross-language and cross-platform implementation. 

The implementation currently supports popular runtimes (Python, C#) and frameworks (LangChain, Semantic Kernel, Prompt flow) with plans to add more. 
The project is [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) and we encourage developers to extend the capabilities to new runtimes and tooling _and contribute those back to the core_ for use by the community.

## 2. Developer Resources

Check back for updates to the documentation site with _tutorials_ (coming soon) and _deep-dives_ (for contributors). In the meantime, here are three more resources to get you started:

<details>
<summary> [**Contoso Creative Writer: Multi-Agent Sample**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-creative-writer) - Click for more details </summary>

Contoso Creative Writer is an app that will help you write well researched, product specific articles. Enter the required information and then click "Start Work". To watch the steps in the agent workflow select the debug button in the bottom right corner of the screen. The result will begin writing once the agents complete the tasks to write the article. |  _The solution is built with Prompty and Azure AI Studio_ - [*Workshop Guide*](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-creative-writer/blob/main/docs/README.md)

<summary> [**Contoso Chat: Retail RAG Sample**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat) - Click for more details </summary>

This sample implements a retail copilot solution for Contoso Outdoor that uses a retrieval augmented generation design pattern to ground chatbot responses in the retailer's product and customer data. Customers can now ask questions from the website in natural language, and get relevant responses along with potential recommendations based on their purchase history - with responsible AI practices to ensure response quality and safety. | _The solution is built with Prompty and Azure AI Studio_ - [*Workshop Guide*](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat/workshop)

<summary> [**Azure AI Solution Templates**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/5pq0uompdgje8d) - Click for more details </summary>

This is a curated set of Azure AI Templates for use with the Azure Developer CLI, and released initially at Microsoft Build 2024. The collection showcases complete end-to-end solutions for diverse application scenarios, languages, and frameworks - using Prompty and Azure AI Studio. Deploy the solution with one command, then customize it to your needs to learn by experimentation.
