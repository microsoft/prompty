## Documentation guidelines
For contributing to the Prompty documentation:

1. Local Setup
    - Our documentation uses MDX (Markdown + JSX) and is built with a static site generator.
    - Install dependencies with `npm install` in the `web` directory.
    - Use Node.js 18+ for best compatibility.

2. Making Changes
    - Documentation files are located in the `docs` directory.
    - Follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions.
    - Use `.mdx` extension for all documentation files.

3. Previewing Changes
    - Start the local development server with `npm run dev` from the `web` directory.
    - View your changes at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
    - The site will hot-reload as you edit files.

4. Building Documentation
    - Test a production build with `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`.
    - Check for any build errors or warnings before submitting your PR.
