_In the last section, we learned how to create and run a Prompty asset. In this section, we will learn how to convert a Prompty asset to Python code and run our first app._

## 1. Pre-requisites

To convert a Prompty asset to code and execute your first app, you need to have the following installed:

- [Python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Prompty Package (Python library)](https://pypi.org/project/prompty/)


For our first app, we will focus on Azure Open AI and cover the following steps:
- Create code from Prompty asset in VS Code
- Install Prompty Package (Python library)
- Configure code (use environment variables)
- Execute code (from command line or VS Code)


## 2. Generate Code from Prompty Asset
Open the `File Explorer` in Visual Studio Code open the Prompty asset we created earlier. Right click on the file name, and in the options, select `add code` then select `add Prompty code`. A new file will be created with the Python code generated from the Prompty asset.

```python
import json
import prompty
# to use the azure invoker make 
# sure to install prompty like this:
# pip install prompty[azure]
import prompty.azure
from prompty.tracer import trace, Tracer, console_tracer, PromptyTracer

# add console and json tracer:
# this only has to be done once
# at application startup
Tracer.add("console", console_tracer)
json_tracer = PromptyTracer()
Tracer.add("PromptyTracer", json_tracer.tracer)

# if your prompty file uses environment variables make
# sure they are loaded properly for correct execution

@trace
def run(    
      question: any
) -> str:

  # execute the prompty file
  result = prompty.execute(
    "shakespeare.prompty", 
    inputs={
      "question": question
    }
  )

  return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
   json_input = '''{
  "question": "Please write a short text inviting friends to a Game Night."
}'''
   args = json.loads(json_input)

   result = run(**args)
   print(result)
```
</details>

## 3. Install Prompty Runtime
When you run the code generated, you will receive the error ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'prompty'``. To resolve this, you need to install the Prompty runtime. The runtime supports different invokers that you can customize based on your needs. In this example, we are using Azure OpenAI API, therefore, we will need to install the ``azure`` invoker. Run the following command in your terminal:

``` pip install prompty[azure] ```

The Prompty Package is a Python runtime that allows you to run your prompts in Python. It is available as a Python package and can be installed using `pip`. 
Depending on the type of prompt you are running, you may need to install additional dependencies. The runtime is designed to be extensible and can be customized to fit your needs.

## 4. Configure environment variables

In the code generated, we will need to load our environment variables to connect our Azure OpenAI API and generate an output. As we had already created the ``.env`` file, you can load the environment variables in your code by adding the following code snippet at the top of your code:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

## 5. Execute the code
You can now run the code by either clicking on the ``run`` button on VS Code or executing the following command in your terminal:

```python shakespeare.py```

<details>
<summary>☑ **You should see this as part of the sample response from the python run** (click to expand)</summary>

```json
Ending execute
result:
"Hark, dear friends! \n\nWith mirth and cheer, I extend a joyous summons unto thee for a night of merry games and friendly rivalry. Let us gather under yon stars at my abode this coming eve, and partake in laughter and revelry most grand. Come, let the spirit of camaraderie guide thy steps to my door, as we engage in diversions that shall bind our hearts in jocund fellowship.\n\nPray, grant me the boon of thy presence. The hour of merriment awaiteth us!\n\nFaithfully thine,  \n[Thy Name]"
Ending run
Hark, dear friends! 

With mirth and cheer, I extend a joyous summons unto thee for a night of merry games and friendly rivalry. Let us gather under yon stars at my abode this coming eve, and partake in laughter and revelry most grand. Come, let the spirit of camaraderie guide thy steps to my door, as we engage in diversions that shall bind our hearts in jocund fellowship.

Pray, grant me the boon of thy presence. The hour of merriment awaiteth us!

Faithfully thine,  
[Thy Name]
```

## 6. How Python code works

1. The ``.py`` code generated first imports the necessary modules and libraries. 

<details>
<summary>☑ **Code importing Prompty, json and Prompty tracer** (click to expand)</summary>
```python
import json
import prompty
# to use the azure invoker make 
# sure to install prompty like this:
# pip install prompty[azure]
import prompty.azure
from prompty.tracer import trace, Tracer, console_tracer, PromptyTracer
```
</details>

2. Next, we add observability using the tracer, allowing you to monitor the execution of the Prompty asset and log the output generated. The next section explains observability and how it works.
<details>
<summary>☑ **Code adding observability using the Prompty tracer** (click to expand)</summary>
```python
# add console and json tracer:
# this only has to be done once
# at application startup
Tracer.add("console", console_tracer)
json_tracer = PromptyTracer()
Tracer.add("PromptyTracer", json_tracer.tracer)
```
</details>

3. Next, we configure the environment variables to connect to the Azure OpenAI API. The code snippet below loads the environment variables from the ``.env`` file.

<details>
<summary>☑ **Code loading the environment variables** (click to expand)</summary>
```python
# if your prompty file uses environment variables make
# sure they are loaded properly for correct execution
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```
</details>


4. Next, we define a function that executes the Prompty asset. The function takes the question as an input and returns the response generated by the Prompty asset. 
<details>
<summary>☑ **Function that executes the Prompty asset** (click to expand)</summary>
```python
@trace
def run(    
      question: any
) -> str:

  # execute the prompty file
  result = prompty.execute(
    "shakespeare.prompty", 
    inputs={
      "question": question
    }
  )

  return result
```
</details>

5. The code also includes a main execution block that loads the input from the prompty file and calls the function to execute the Prompty asset. The result is printed to the console.

<details>
<summary>☑ **Main execution code block** (click to expand)</summary>
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
   json_input = '''{
  "question": "Please write a short text inviting friends to a Game Night."
}'''
   args = json.loads(json_input)

   result = run(**args)
```
</details>






## 7. Additional supported runtimes

The Prompty runtime supports additional runtimes, including frameworks such as [LangChain](tutorials/using-langchain/), and [Semantic Kernel](tutorials/using-semantic-kernel/). In the tutorials section, we will cover how to generate code from Prompty assets using these runtimes. (coming soon)
