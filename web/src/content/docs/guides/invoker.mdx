_In this section, we cover the different built-in Prompty Invokers and walk you through how you can build your own custom invoker._

## 1. Prompty invokers

The Prompty runtime comes with a set of built-in invokers that can be used to execute external models and APIs. 
Invokers trigger a call to a the different models and return its output ensuring standardization when it comes to handling models. The invokers currently supported are:

1. **azure**: Invokes the Azure OpenAI API
2. **openai**: Invokes the OpenAI API
3. **serverless**: Invokes serverless models (e.g. GitHub Models) using the Azure AI Inference client library (currently only key based authentication is supported with more managed identity support coming soon)


TODO: Explain how invokers work and how to build a custom invoker
