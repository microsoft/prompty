  <Info reversed={false} title="What is Prompty?" image="/images/prompty-venn.svg">
    Prompty is an asset class and format for LLM prompts that aims to
    provide observability, understandability, and portability for
    developers - the primary goal is to speed up the developer inner
    loop.

    Prompty is comprised of 3 things
    
      - the specification,
      - its tooling,
      - and runtime.
  </Info>
  <Info reversed={true} title="The specification" image="/images/spec.png">
  Prompty is intended to be a language agnostic asset class for 
  creating and managing prompts.
  
    - Uses common markdown format
    - Modified front-matter to specify metadata, model settings, sample data (among other things)
    - Content in a standard template format
  </Info>
  <Info reversed={false} title="The tooling" image="/images/tools.png">
  Given the standard specification, there's a lot of nice things we can
  give developers in their environment.
  
  - Front matter autocompletion
  - Colorization / syntax highlighting
  - Validation (with red squiggles for undefined variables)
  - Quick run
  - Code generation
  - Evaluation generation
  </Info>
  <Info reversed={true} title="The runtime" image="/images/runtime.png">
    Prompty runtime is the whatever engine that understands and 
    can execute the format. As a standalone file, it can't really 
    do anything without the help of the extension (when developing) 
    or the runtime (when running).
    
      - Works in Python
      - Works in C#
      - (In progress) works in TypeScript/JavaScript

  <Number number={2} title="Language agnostic">
    Use with any language or framework you are familiar with.

  <Info reversed={false} title="Standards open doors" image="/images/prompty-graph.png">
    By working in a common format we open up opportunities for new improvements.
    
    - By default all prompty executions will produce tracing for each prompty called
    - Developers can add additional tracing via simple SDK functions
    - Tracing output uses OpenTelemetry so any/all existing tooling around that standard can be used to visualize the tracing output.
  </Info>
  <Info reversed={true} title="Works for everyone" image="/images/prompty-ascii-art-globe.png">
    Prompty is built on the premise that even with increasing complexity in AI, a 
    fundamental unit remains prompts. And understanding this can lead to more innovative 
    developments in AI applications, for everyone.
